Processing

Networked across 2 machines 


Code screen border values early, left right top bottom 

Battlefield needs to be scaled to screen
Have battlefield position and screen position be independent (convert client side)
Work out Processing full screen (preferably windowed borderless)

Moving stuff
Draw ship and background 
Make ship clickable
Implement arc of movement graphically 
Implement mandatory moves 


Gameplay stuff
Create a main class that controls active player 
Create player classes that own ships 
Control phase and turn 


Networking stuff 
Make everything relevant serialisable 
Give the game some way to track who the other client is and send through the whole instance of itself 

Object stuff 
Create a framework to create objects ie different ship sizes within that classes 
Non ship objects movable and immovable, collidable and non collidable 





Eventually implement a gui of ships alive to show what has and hasnâ€™t moved. 

Remember to complete all remaining mandatory moves at the end of movement.
